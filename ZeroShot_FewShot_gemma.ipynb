She noted complaints of fatigue, lightheadedness, and severe dyspnea on exertion. She was evaluated by her PCP on January 31st and her ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 37 beats per minute. She has had intermittent severe sinus bradycardia alternating with a normal sinus rhythm, consistent with sinoatrial exit block, and she is on no medications known to cause bradycardia. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70% without significant valvular heart disease.,PROCEDURE:, Implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker.,APPROACH:, Left cephalic vein.,LEADS IMPLANTED: ,Medtronic model 12345 in the right atrium, serial number 12345. Medtronic 12345 in the right ventricle, serial number 12345.,DEVICE IMPLANTED: ,Medtronic EnRhythm model 12345, serial number 12345.,LEAD PERFORMANCE: ,Atrial threshold less than 1.3 volts at 0.5 milliseconds. P wave 3.3 millivolts. Impedance 572 ohms. Right ventricle threshold 0.9 volts at 0.5 milliseconds. R wave 10.3. Impedance 855.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, 20 mL.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in a fasting state and intravenous sedation was provided as needed with Versed and fentanyl. The left neck and chest were prepped and draped in the usual manner and the skin and subcutaneous tissues below the left clavicle were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 2-1/2-inch incision was made below the left clavicle and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Dissection was carried out to the level of the pectoralis fascia and extended caudally to create a pocket for the pulse generator. The deltopectoral groove was explored and a medium-sized cephalic vein was identified. The distal end of the vein was ligated and a venotomy was performed. Two guide wires were advanced to the superior vena cava and peel-away introducer sheaths were used to insert the two pacing leads. The venous pressures were elevated and there was a fair amount of back-bleeding from the vein, so a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed around the tissue surrounding the vein for hemostasis. The right ventricular lead was placed in the high RV septum and the right atrial lead was placed in the right atrial appendage. The leads were tested with a pacing systems analyzer and the results are noted above. The leads were then anchored in place with #0-silk around their suture sleeve and connected to the pulse generator. The pacemaker was noted to function appropriately. The pocket was then irrigated with antibiotic solution and the pacemaker system was placed in the pocket. The incision was closed with two layers of 3-0 Monocryl and a subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. The incision was dressed with Steri-Strips and a sterile bandage and the patient was returned to her room in good condition.,IMPRESSION: ,Successful implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker via the left cephalic vein. The patient will be observed overnight and will go home in the morning.\",\n          \"2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAM,Multiple views of the heart and great vessels reveal normal intracardiac and great vessel relationships.  Cardiac function is normal.  There is no significant chamber enlargement or hypertrophy.  There is no pericardial effusion or vegetations seen.  Doppler interrogation, including color flow imaging, reveals systemic venous return to the right atrium with normal tricuspid inflow.  Pulmonary outflow is normal at the valve.  Pulmonary venous return is to the left atrium.  The interatrial septum is intact.  Mitral inflow and ascending aorta flow are normal.  The aortic valve is trileaflet.  The coronary arteries appear to be normal in their origins.  The aortic arch is left-sided and patent with normal descending aorta pulsatility.\",\n          \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Posterior mediastinal mass with possible neural foraminal involvement.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Posterior mediastinal mass with possible neural foraminal involvement (benign nerve sheath tumor by frozen section).,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Left thoracotomy with resection of posterior mediastinal mass.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 23-year-old woman who recently presented with a posterior mediastinal mass and on CT and MRI there were some evidence of potential widening of one of the neural foramina.  For this reason, Dr. X and I agreed to operate on this patient together.  Please note that two surgeons were required for this case due to the complexity of it.  The indications and risks of the procedure were explained and the patient gave her informed consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating suite and placed in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was given with a double lumen tube.  The patient was positioned for a left thoracotomy.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A muscle sparing incision was created several centimeters anterior to the tip of the scapula.  The serratus and latissimus muscles were retracted.  The intercostal space was opened.  We then created a thoracoscopy port inferiorly through which we placed a camera for lighting and for visualization.  Through our small anterior thoracotomy and with the video-assisted scope placed inferiorly we had good visualization of the posterior mediastinum mass.  This was in the upper portion of the mediastinum just posterior to the subclavian artery and aorta.  The lung was deflated and allowed to retract anteriorly.  With a combination of blunt and sharp dissection and with attention paid to hemostasis, we were able to completely resect the posterior mediastinal mass.  We began by opening the tumor and taking a very wide large biopsy.  This was sent for frozen section, which revealed a benign nerve sheath tumor.  Then, using the occluder device Dr. X was able to _____ the inferior portions of the mass.  This left the external surface of the mass much more malleable and easier to retract.  Using a bipolar cautery and endoscopic scissors we were then able to completely resect it.  Once the tumor was resected, it was then sent for permanent sections.  The entire hemithorax was copiously irrigated and hemostasis was complete.  In order to prevent any lymph leak, we used 2 cc of Evicel and sprayed this directly on to the raw surface of the pleural space.  A single chest tube was inserted through our thoracoscopy port and tunneled up one interspace.  The wounds were then closed in multiple layers.  A #2 Vicryl was used to approximate the ribs.  The muscles of the chest wall were allowed to return to their normal anatomic position.  A 19 Blake was placed in the subcutaneous tissues.  Subcutaneous tissues and skin were closed with running absorbable sutures.  The patient was then rolled in the supine position where she was awakened from general endotracheal anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sample_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1294,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Cemented Arthroplasty\",\n          \"Neuropsychological Evaluation - 1\",\n          \"Colon Cancer Screening\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"medical_specialty\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hematology - Oncology\",\n          \"Pediatrics - Neonatal\",\n          \"Cardiovascular / Pulmonary\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 971,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"orthopedic, rotator cuff tear, cuff tear, rotator cuff, joint, mri, rotator, cuff, shoulder, tear,\",\n          \"hematology - oncology, double-lumen, endotracheal, pleural surface, chest tube, pleural biopsy, malignant mesothelioma, vats pleurodesis, pleural biopsies, pleural effusion, pleural, vats, pleurodesis, mesothelioma,\",\n          \"orthopedic, origin of stalk, extensor retinaculum, wrist ganglion, incision, excision, dorsal, tourniquet, wrist, ganglion\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
